# HTML and JS

A basic webpage contains HTML tags, and that's everything that we've seen so far. To include our CSS to style page, we included a separate style file using a link tag. Similarly, we can use a script tag to add JavaScript into our webpage to make things interactive.

## Adding a JS file
- Try adding a JS file. With Thimble, you'll see that it comes populated with some information by default!
- Notice that there's a function that prints a message to the console. Now let's link this file to our webpage by adding a script tag. 
- If we now refresh our webpage, you'll see the message printed to our console!
- Now we're only scratching the surface here, although it's cool to see a message printed to a console when you view a webpage - linking JavaScript files in our HTML means we can do anything we want with JavaScript.

## Exercise
- Try adding a separate JavaScript file and change the message that gets outputted to the console to be "Today is a good day".
