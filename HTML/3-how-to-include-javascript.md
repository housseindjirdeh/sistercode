# HTML and JavaScript

--

### Inline JavaScript

A basic webpage contains HTML tags and that's everything that we've seen so far. But if we wanted to make things interactive, we'll need JavaScript. We can add JavaScript by adding it inline to each of our HTML elements

### Between script tags

Instead of adding JavaScript inline, we can write javascript between script tags instead.

### External files

The most common and preferred way is write our JavaScript in a separate file. We can link to them using the src attribute of the script tag.
