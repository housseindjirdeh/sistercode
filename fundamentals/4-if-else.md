# If/Else
Teaching our program to make decisions

--

# If Statements let our program do some things and not others

--

![Variable Example!](ASSETS_PATH/fundamentals/ifelse/ifelse.png)

--

# Condition
Code that your program will check first to see how it should proceed

![Variable Example!](ASSETS_PATH/fundamentals/ifelse/ifelse.png)

--

# Your condition is a Boolean
JavaScript will turn it into either `true` or `false`

--

# Body
Code that your program will only run when the condition is `true`

![Variable Example!](ASSETS_PATH/fundamentals/ifelse/ifelse.png)

--

# Unreachable code

```js
if (true) { // This is the Boolean type true, so condition will always be true
  console.log('I will always be printed!');
} else {
  console.log('What about me?'); // This will never run
}
```

--

# Comparison operators
Comparisons operators let us build conditions

--

```js
=== // Equals
< // Less Than
> // Greater Than
<= // Less than or Equal To
>= // Greater than or Equal To 
&& // AND
|| // OR
```

--

# You can nest if statements!
Now your program is getting complicated
